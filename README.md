# Zephyr 2-Day Workshop

This repository contains the materials, code, and resources for a hands-on 2-day Zephyr RTOS workshop.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Learn the fundamentals of embedded development using the [Zephyr RTOS](https://www.zephyrproject.org/). By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Set up and configure a Zephyr-based project
- Understand and modify DeviceTree and Kconfig
- Work with sensors via the Zephyr sensor subsystem
- Build applications with threads, workqueues, and logging
- Use the Zephyr shell interface for runtime interaction
- Develop BLE and USB-capable applications
- Combine features into a final wireless system project

## ðŸ“… Schedule

| 15:00â€“18:00  | Final Workshop Project           |

## ðŸ§© Final Project

The final workshop challenge includes:

- Connecting a TMP102 sensor to an nRF52DK
- Sending temperature data over BLE to an nRF52840DK
- Printing sensor data periodically on the central
- Supporting shell access via USB RNDIS and Telnet

See the `/final_project/` folder for instructions and code template.
